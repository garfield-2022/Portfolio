ETL Extract bank and market cap data

This is the project for the course Python Project for Data Engineering offered by IBM on Coursera.org. One is required to run the ETL process, extract bank and market cap data from the JSON file bank_market_cap.json, transform the market cap currency using the exchange rate data, and load the transformed data into a separate CSV file.

Datasets ready for download and use:

JSON file bank_market_cap_1.json to extract market cap data,
CSV file exchange_rates.csv to find the exchange rate for British pounds.
Final table will be stored in a new CSV file named bank_market_cap_gbp.csv. One is also required to log the process accordingly in the TEXT file logfile.txt.
